QIIME 2 overview
================

QIIME 2 is a complete redesign and rewrite of the `QIIME 1`_ microbiome analysis pipeline. QIIME 2 will address many of the limitations of QIIME 1, while retaining the features that makes QIIME 1 a powerful and widely-used analysis pipeline.

QIIME 2 is ready for experimental use while in its alpha release stage. **It currently supports an initial end-to-end microbiome analysis pipeline.** Because our microbiome analysis functionality is currently very new, QIIME 2 is not yet recommended as a replacement for QIIME 1, but we are very interested in having users test QIIME 2 and give us feedback. Until the QIIME 2 microbiome analysis functionality has expanded, we recommend that you continue to use `QIIME 1`_ and `Qiita`_ for your microbiome analyses, as these will provide you with complete analysis solutions supporting high-performance computing environments.

New functionality will regularly become available through QIIME 2 plugins. You can view a list of plugins, including those that are currently available, in development, or being planned, on the QIIME 2 :doc:`plugins <plugins>` page.

To see where we're headed with QIIME 2, take a look at Greg Caporaso's `American Gut blog post`_ (15 April 2016) and `SciPy 2016 presentation`_ (15 July 2016).

Getting started
---------------

To begin experimenting with QIIME 2, start with the :doc:`installation guide <install>`, which will show you how to install the QIIME 2 framework, a command-line interface, and some plugins used in the :doc:`tutorials <tutorials/index>`.

Staying updated

Requesting features, reporting bugs, providing feedback
-------------------------------------------------------

If there is specific functionality you'd like to see in QIIME 2, you notice a bug, or want to leave feedback, please post to the QIIME 2 `issue tracker`_. We appreciate all feedback as we strive to make QIIME 2 a useful and accessible tool for microbiome analyses.
